# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- npm create vite@latest
- run npm install inside the project
- run npm run dev to start the app

- install React dev tools chrome extention
- install Reactjs in VS Code
- install ESLint in VS code
- install Prettier code formatter in VS code

- Use https://github.com/axios/axios as alternative to call async
- https://docs.github.com/en/rest documentaion

- https://api.openweathermap.org weather data
- https://js.coach is a good resource to get thirdt-party react components
